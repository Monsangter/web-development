Html responsive

If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size:

1HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in element names.

However, we recommend using lowercase element names, because:

Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad
Developers normally use lowercase names
Lowercase looks cleaner
Lowercase is easier to write

2Close All HTML Elements

3Always Quote Attribute Values
HTML allows attribute values without quotes.

However, we recommend quoting attribute values, because:

Developers normally quote attribute values
Quoted values are easier to read
You MUST use quotes if the value contains spaces

4Spaces and Equal Signs
HTML allows spaces around equal signs. But space-less is easier to read and groups entities better together.

5Avoid Long Code Lines
When using an HTML editor, it is NOT convenient to scroll right and left to read the HTML code.

Try to avoid too long code lines.

Do not add blank lines, spaces, or indentations without a reason.

For readability, add blank lines to separate large or logical code blocks.

For readability, add two spaces of indentation. Do not use the tab key.

6Never Skip the <title> Element
The <title> element is required in HTML.

The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

The <title> element:

defines a title in the browser toolbar
provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
displays a title for the page in search-engine results
So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible: 

7Omitting <html> and <body>?

Omitting <body> can produce errors in older browsers.

Omitting <html> and <body> can also crash DOM and XML software.

8.Close Empty HTML Elements?

<meta charset="utf-8" />

If you expect XML/XHTML software to access your page, keep the closing slash (/), because it is required in XML and XHTML.

9Add the lang Attribute
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

10.Meta Data
To ensure proper interpretation and correct search engine indexing, both the language and the character encoding <meta charset="charset"> should be defined as early as possible in an HTML document:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
